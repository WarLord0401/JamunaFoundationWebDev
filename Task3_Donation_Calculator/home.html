          <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
          <p id="paragraph">
            Founded in 2017, Jamuna Foundation has been dedicated to changing
            and shaping lives through impactful community service. From our
            humble beginnings, we have grown into a trusted NGO committed to
            addressing some of society’s biggest challenges.<br /><br />
            Over the years, we have launched initiatives for women’s
            self-employment, adult education, digital empowerment, and skill
            development under national programs like Digital India and Pradhan
            Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY).<br /><br />
            Our journey reflects a consistent commitment to empowering
            individuals and building stronger, more self-reliant communities.

          <h2>OUR VISION</h2>
          <p id="paragraph">
            Our vision is to create an inclusive and empowered society where
            every individual has access to education, skills, healthcare, and
            opportunities for growth. <br /><br />
            We aim to eliminate barriers that prevent people from realizing
            their potential, whether through vocational training, health
            services, environmental action, or social justice advocacy.
            <br /><br />
            We envision a future where poverty is reduced, dignity is preserved,
            and communities work together for sustainable progress.
